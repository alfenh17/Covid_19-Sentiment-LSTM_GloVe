# Covid_19-Sentiment-LSTM_GloVe
This is a sentiment analysis project related to twitter covid-19 omicron tweets in 2022.

This project gathers tweet data related to covid-19 variant omicron on February 2022 in English. I use positive and negative label to score all the tweets. 

The keywords while obtanining the tweet from scratch is "omicron", "Omicron", "#omicron", "#Omicron", "B.1.1.529 variant", "BA.2 variant", "#BA2 variant", and
"ba.2 variant".

This project implements deep learning model LSTM from scratch and 100-D pretrained GloVe Word Embedding model to convert words into vectors.
